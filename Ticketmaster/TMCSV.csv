The Forgotten Carols is the story of Constance, a rigid yet competent nurse, too practical to be bothered by Christmas. She is assigned to care for an aged gentleman with alleged senile episodes over the holiday season. But this unlikely patient, John, is nothing like the senile ""crazy"" she expected. With warmth and spunky kindness, John eventually breaks through Constance's iron-clad exterior as he walks her through the untold carols of the more ""forgotten"" characters in the Christmas story and guides the young nurse to the Christmas carol waiting to be sung inside her own heart. Come join us for a wonderful evening filled with the spirit of the holidays!","All patrons must have a ticket, including infants in arms. Venue is accessible to all patrons.

Drawing equally from horror movies, vaudeville, and garage rock, the group created a stage show that featured electric chairs, guillotines, fake blood and boa constrictors. He continues to tour regularly, performing shows worldwide with the dark and horror-themed theatrics that he's best known for. With a schedule that includes six months each year on the road, Alice Cooper brings his own brand of rock psycho-drama to fans both old and new, enjoying it as much as the audience does. Known as the architect of shock-rock, Cooper (in both the original Alice Cooper band and as a solo artist) has rattled the cages and undermined the authority of generations of guardians of the status quo, continuing to surprise fans and exude danger at every turn, like a great horror movie, even in an era where CNN can present real life shocking images.","MUST BE AGE 21 OR OLDER TO ATTEND!

With warmth and spunky kindness, John eventually breaks through Constance's iron-clad exterior as he walks her through the untold carols of the more ""forgotten"" characters in the Christmas story and guides the young nurse to the Christmas carol waiting to be sung inside her own heart.
